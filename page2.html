        <h1>Methods</h1>
        <p>HTTP methods are used to indicate the action an API client would like to perform on a given resource. Each HTTP method maps to a specific operation, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting a resource, and an HTTP method must be included with every request to a REST API.</p>

      <p> The GET method is used to retrieve data on a server. Clients can use the GET method to access all of the resources of a given type, or they can use it to access a specific resource. For instance, a GET request to the /products endpoint of an e-commerce API would return all of the products in the database, while a GET request to the /products/123 endpoint would return the specific product with an ID of 123.</p>

      <p>The POST method is used to create new resources. For instance, if the manager of an e-commerce store wanted to add a new product to the database, they would send a POST request to the /products endpoint. Unlike GET requests, POST requests typically include a request body, which is where the client specifies the attributes of the resource to be created. For example, a POST request to the /products endpoint might have a request body that looks like this:</p>
