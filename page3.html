        <h1>Requests</h1>
        <p>HTTP requests are the primary way of communicating between a client and a server. Once the client makes a request, the server validates the request and acts according to the request method delivering an HTTP response which, similarly to the request, contains a status line, a header, and a message body.</p>
      <br>
      <p> An HTTP request method is a way to indicate the desired action to be performed by a resource. While some of them are nouns, HTTP methods are referred to as verbs. At the same time, they are case-sensitive and always written in upper case. There are various HTTP request methods, each having its own purpose.</p>
